# Data-Wrangling

Overview

This project demonstrates data wrangling techniques using Python. The notebook walks through the process of loading, cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for analysis. The goal is to showcase practical skills in handling messy, real-world data and making it ready for further exploration or machine learning tasks.
